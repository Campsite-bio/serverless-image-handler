## CDK Solution Helper

**For aws-solutions internal purposes only**

`cdk-solution-helper` runs on solution internal pipeline and makes needed artifact modifications to support 1-click deployment using solution CloudFormation template.
Additionally, it packages templates and lambda binaries and prepares them to be staged on the solution buckets. 

It does the following:
+ Replace references to local cdk generated assets in the template with solution assets

For eg.
> cdk-hnb659fds-assets-${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region} --> solutions-${AWS::Region}

+ Package lambda and UI assets generated by cdk and stage them on solution buckets
